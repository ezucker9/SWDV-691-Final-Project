This project is for a combination To-Do list and Pomodoro timer to help increase user's productivity. This project will have
a MySQL database that will store tasks and goals that the users will be working toward as well as a timer to track the amount
of time they're taking to try and complete that task. There will be information on the Pomodoro method and how to work the app
displayed to the user on the first screen.
